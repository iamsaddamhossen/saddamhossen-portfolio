      <p className="mb-6">
        As a WordPress developer since 2009, I’ve had the pleasure of working
        with large corporations, universities, advertising agencies, publishers,
        law firms, and non-profit organizations.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        In 2020 I co-founded CultivateWP, a WordPress agency focusing on high
        performance sites for web publishers.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I’ve contributed to WordPress core by fixing bugs and helping build new
        features. I was also a contributing developer to the Genesis theme
        framework.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I have been so fortunate to build a career on top of WordPress. I’ve
        contributed what I can to help the WordPress community that has helped
        me so much. I share WordPress tutorials on my blog, my free WordPress
        plugins, and through code snippets. I’ve presented at many WordPress
        conferences and community events.
